/**
 * Helper: Manually clip large list of items.
 * If you are submitting lots of evenly spaced items and you have a random access to the list, you can perform coarse clipping based on visibility to save yourself from processing those items at all.
 * The clipper calculates the range of visible items and advance the cursor to compensate for the non-visible items we have skipped.
 * ImGui already clip items based on their bounds but it needs to measure text size to do so. Coarse clipping before submission makes this cost and your own data fetching/submission cost null.
 * Usage:
 * <pre>
 *     ImGuiListClipper clipper(1000);  // we have 1000 elements, evenly spaced.
 *     while (clipper.Step())
 *         for (int i = clipper.DisplayStart; i {@code <} clipper.DisplayEnd; i++)
 *             ImGui::Text("line number %d", i);
 * </pre>
 * - Step 0: the clipper let you process the first element, regardless of it being visible or not, so we can measure the element height (step skipped if we passed a known height as second arg to constructor).
 * - Step 1: the clipper infer height from first element, calculate the actual range of elements to display, and position the cursor before the first element.
 * - (Step 2: dummy step only required if an explicit items_height was passed to constructor or Begin() and user call Step(). Does nothing and switch to Step 3.)
 * - Step 3: the clipper validate that we have reached the expected Y position (corresponding to element DisplayEnd), advance the cursor to the end of the list and then returns 'false' to end the loop.
 * <p>
 * BINDING NOTICE:
 * It's impossible to implement the same API like in the original. Method {@link #forEach(int, int, ImListClipperCallback)} could be used instead.
 * <pre>
 *     ImGuiListClipper.forEach(1000, new ImListClipperCallback() {
 *         public void accept(int index) {
 *             ImGui.text(String.format("line number %d", index));
 *         }
 *     });
 * </pre>
